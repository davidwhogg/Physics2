Due Thursday 2020 May 7 before lecture.

In class we considered a plane-parallel sinusoidal wave of the form
\begin{align}
  \vec{E} &= E_0\,\hat{x}\,\cos(k\,z - \omega t) \\
  \vec{B} &= B_0\,\hat{y}\,\cos(k\,z - \omega t) \quad ,
\end{align}
where $E_0$ and $B_0$ are amplitudes, $k$ is the magnitude of a
wave number, and $\omega$ is an angular frequency.
The $y$ component of the Maxwell's equation involving
$\curl{\vec{E}}$ in vacuum is
\begin{align}
  \frac{\dd}{\dd z}E_x - \frac{\dd}{\dd x}E_z = -\frac{\dd}{\dd t}B_y
  \quad ,
\end{align}
and the $x$ component of the equation involving $\curl{\vec{B}}$ is
\begin{align}
  \frac{\dd}{\dd y}B_z - \frac{\dd}{\dd z}B_y = \mu_0\,\epsilon_0\,\frac{\dd}{\dd t}E_x
  \quad .
\end{align}
Show---by taking the derivatives and plugging in---that the given forms
for the electric and magnetic fields can
satisfy these equations, provided that there is some particular relationship
between $E_0$ and $B_0$ and some particular relationship between $k$ and $\omega$.
What are those relationships?

You should be able to write an
expression for the ratio $E_0/B_0$ and an expression for the ratio $\omega/k$.
Both of these expressions should depend only on fundamental constants
$\mu_0$, $\epsilon_0$, and $c$.

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
In different wavelength regions, physicists tend to use different
units to describe photons. Make a table giving the wavelength
$\lambda$, wave number $k$, frequency $f$, angular frequency $\omega$,
and energy $E$ of each of the following photons:
\begin{itemize}
\item a radio wave at $f=70\,\GHz$ detected by ESA \textsl{Planck}
\item an infrared photon at $\lambda=10\,\mum$ emitted by Earth to space
\item a blue photon at $\lambda=410\,\nm$ absorbed by a leaf in photosynthesis
\item an x-ray at $E=1.02\,\MeV$ emitted by electron--positron annihilation
\end{itemize}
For the energies $E$ you will have to use that a photon has energy $E=h\,f$
where $h$ is the Planck constant. Give your answers in SI units except for the
energies, which you should give in $\eV$.
