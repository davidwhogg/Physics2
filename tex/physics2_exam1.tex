(From Lecture, 2020-02-13)
What, roughly, is the voltage at which high-tension (long distance) power lines run?
Give your answer as a number in volts.

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
(From Problem Set 3)
Imagine you have two plates of very large area $A$ separated by a very small distance $h$.
There is charge $+Q$ on the bottom plate and $-Q$ on the top plate.
What is the field $\vec{E}$ between those plates? Give the magnitude and direction.
Assume that there is nothing else nearby.
Give a symbolic expression in terms of $A$, $h$, $Q$, and anything else you need.

(From Lecture, 2020-02-20)
Imagine you have an isolated charged sphere of radius $a$, holding
charge $Q$ on its surface.
What is the potential difference $V$ between a point on the surface (that
is, at radius $a$ and a point at larger radius $b$?
Give your answer as an expression in terms of $Q$, $a$, $b$, and
anything else you might need.
