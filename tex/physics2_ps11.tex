A low-pass filter for voltage can be created as shown....

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Imagine you have a long straight wire running along the $x$-axis.
Now imagine that centered at $x=0$ there is a parallel-plate capacitor
with circular plates of radius $a$, separated by a tiny gap $h\ll a$,
with the plates perpendicular to the wire.
Current $I$ is flowing in the $x$ direction, so the capacitor is charging.
Consider an Ampere's law loop of radius $r$ that is circular
and centered on the origin, and lying in the $y$--$z$ plane.
That is, the loop is centered in the gap between the plates of the capacitor.
Using the $\dd\vec{E}/\dd t$ term in Maxwell's equations,
compute the magnetic field magnitude $|\vec{B}|$ as a function of $r$ over
the range $0<r<3\,a$.
Plot your result $|\vec{B}|$ \foreign{vs} $r$, labeling the value at
$r=0$ and the maximum value.
Show that at $r>a$ you get for $|\vec{B}|$ what you would have gotten if you had just used
the $\mu_0\,I$ term.
