\section*{NYU Physics 2 --- Problem Set 1}

\emph{Due by Friday 2002 February 1 at 1pm at Irene Port's office in
Meyer 424.}

\subsection*{Problem 1}

Imagine that the charge on the proton is bigger in magnitude than the
charge on the electron by 1 part in a trillion ($10^{12}$).  What is
the magnitude of the electrostatic force between you and a friend who
is $1~\mathrm{m}$ away?  How much total work did the two of you have
to do to get that close to one another (assuming you started very far
apart)?

\subsection*{Problem 2}

A charge of $1~\mathrm{C}$ is fixed at the origin ($\vec{r}=\vec{0}$),
and a charge of $-2~\mathrm{C}$ is located at
$\vec{r}=(1~\mathrm{m})\,\hat\imath$.  Find (a) a point on the $x$
axis where the electric field vanishes, and (b) a point on the $y$
axis where the electric field is parallel to the $x$ axis.  For part
(b) you might need to use some trial and error; be sure to show your
work.  Sketch the electric field lines in the $x$--$y$ plane.

\subsection*{Problem 3}

A charge $+Q$ is constrained to move along the $x$ axis between two
fixed charges, one of charge $-Q$ at position $x=0$, and one of charge
$-3\,Q$ at position $x=\ell$.  Plot the $x$ component of the force
$F_x$ on charge $+Q$ as a function of its position $x$, and plot the
total energy $U$ of the charge configuration as a function of $x$.
What is the equilibrium position for charge $+Q$?
