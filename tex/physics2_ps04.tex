\section*{NYU Physics 2---Problem Set 4}

Due Thursday 2020 February 27 at the beginning of lecture.

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Repeat the calculation Javan did in Lecture on 2020-02-20 for a
spherical capacitor, but for a plane-parallel capacitor of very large
area $A$ and very small separation $h$ between the plates. You can do
this by assuming that the plates are infinitely large when you compute
the field, but finite area when you compute the total charge
$Q$. Derive an expression for this capactance; your
expression should be in terms of $A$ and $h$. Compare your answer to
answers on the internet; are you good?

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Look up the total storage capacity of the battery system of a
commercial fully-electric car, like a Volt, Tesla, or eGolf. It might
be given in amp-hours, or it might be given in joules or
joules-equivalent (like hp-hours or gallons of gasoline
equivalent). And look up also what voltage at which the automobile
power systems run. Is it $12\,\V$ or higher? Now what kind of
capacitance $C$ would it take to replace the battery system with a
(far, far superior) capacitive system? If you started with amp-hours
or coulombs, then also compute what energy is stored when the system
is fully charged. That is, we want to know, in SI units, the voltage,
charge, capacitance, and stored energy of the system. Now imagine that
the capacitors in the system consist of two very thin sheets separated
by $1\,\mum$.  What would be the total area $A$ you would need for all
those sheets? Again, SI units.

Extra part, \emph{not for credit:} Does the energy storage make sense
if you want a fully-charged driving range of hundreds of miles? How
would you even compute that?

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Expressions for capacitance involve ratios of area to distance.  That
ratio has units of length. What is the capacitance corresponding to
the radius of the Earth. Interpret this capacitance. Compare it to the
capacitance of capacitors that you can buy (for, say, less than
100\,USD) on the internet. Can you buy a capacitor with \emph{more
  capacitance than the entire Earth}? If so, how or why? What gives?

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Imagine you add two capacitors in parallel. Make a heuristic argument
that the capacitances should add together. Imagine you add two capacitors
in series. Make a heuristic argument that the inverse-capacitances should
add together. That is, don't use equations, use words and your brain.
