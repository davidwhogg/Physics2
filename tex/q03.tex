This exam consists of two problems.  Write only in this booklet.  Be
sure to show your work.

\section*{Problem 1}

\vspace{1.5in}

A current flows in a long, bent wire as shown.

(a) What is the direction of the magnetic field at point P?

\vfill

(b) What is the direction of the force on ``leg A'' of the wire
from the magnetic field produced by ``leg B''?  Draw a diagram
showing the direction of the force and field.

\section*{Problem 2}

\vspace{1.5in}

A ring of metal is thrown horizontally into a region of
magnetic field (into the page) as shown.  Ignore gravity.

(a) What is the direction of the emf in the ring?  Justify your answer.

\vfill

(b) What is the direction of the force on the ring?  Give a value for
the force in Newtons, when the ring is exactly halfway in.  Assume
that the magnetic field strength is 0.1~T and the ring has a
resistance of $R=0.8~\mathrm{\Omega}$, a radius of $a=0.01~\mathrm{m}$
and is moving at speed $v=15~\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$.  State any
approximations you need to make!
