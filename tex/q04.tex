This exam consists of two problems.  Write only in this booklet.  Be
sure to show your work.

\section*{Problem 1}

\noindent
~\hfill\includegraphics{dc_circuit5.eps}\hfill~\\
In the circuit shown, the switch is closed at time $t=0$.

(a) What are the currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ in resistors $R_1$ and
$R_2$, immediately after the switch is closed?

\vfill

(b) What are the currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$?
Note that you do \emph{not} have to get part (a) to get this part, but
explain your answer.

\section*{Problem 2}

\noindent
~\hfill\includegraphics{dc_circuit6.eps}\hfill~\\
In the circuit shown, the AC voltage source produces a voltage that
varies with time as ${\cal E}= {\cal E}_0\,\cos\omega t$.

(a) What is the resonant frequency of the circuit?

\vfill

(b) What is the time-averaged power dissipation $\left<P_R\right>$ in
the resistor, when the AC voltage source is run at the resonant
frequency?  Note that you do \emph{not} have to get part (a) to get
this part, but explain your answer.
