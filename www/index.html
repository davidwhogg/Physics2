<h1>NYU Physics 2</h1>

<p><i>This page was for the Spring 2002 semester.</i></p>

<p>Physics 2 (V85.0093) is an introductory electromagnetism course in
the <a href="http://physics.nyu.edu/">NYU Physics Department</a>
intended for engineering and science majors.</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>There is a small amount of reading assigned (below) for each week.
You will benefit enormously from reading it twice, once <b>before</b>
the relevant lectures, and once again <b>after</b>.</p>

<h2>Problem sets</h2>

<p>A problem set will be posted on this WWW page (below) each week by
the Wednesday; it will be due the following Thursday by 4:30pm in
Meyer 424.</p>

<p>If you are not going to be able to complete a problem set on time,
ask for an extension from Prof Hogg <b>in advance</b>.  Problem sets
handed in late without granted extensions will be graded for half
credit unless there is a medical excuse.  Problem sets not handed in
will be assigned grades of zero.</p>

<p>Please feel free to discuss the problem set questions and solutions
with other students and with the tutor.  However, you must ensure that
the work you hand in is your own.  This is required by the principles
of academic honesty; but it is also the case that you will not perform
well on the exams if you have not worked out the problem sets
yourself.</p>

<p>Problem sets serve a double purpose. They provide you with practice
problems, and they provide the instructors with an evaluation of your
skills.  Keep these goals in mind as you work on the problem sets.
Even wrong answers will be graded for partial credit; it is your
responsibility to make sure your answers contain enough explanation,
illustration, and physical reasoning to earn that credit.</p>

<h2>Tutoring</h2>

<p>There is free tutoring available with Brett Ulrich on a schedule
given above.  The location is Meyer 639 or 613 (although sometimes it
migrates to other rooms; information will be posted).  Do not hesitate
to use this for help with weekly reading, problem sets, or studying.
In addition, Brett will do review sessions for some exams.</p>
 
<h2>Examinations</h2>

<p>There will be four short in-class examinations during the term, and
a final exam at the end.  Each in-class exam will be given in the last
30 min of class time on the specified date.  The subjects covered are
given in the chart below.</p>

<p>The final exam will consist of about six short problems, one of
which will be taken directly from the problem sets, one of which will
be taken directly from the in-class exams, and one of which will be
taken from the practice problems shown in the syllabus, below.</p>

<p>If you have to miss an examination for any non-medical reason, you
must make arrangements with Prof Hogg <b>in advance</b>.  Missed exams
(with no medical excuse or special arrangement) will be given grades
of zero.</p>

<p>As with the problem sets, make sure you show your work.  Most of
the evaluation is based on your reasoning; only part of the credit is
earned with a correct answer.</p>

<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<p>Note: Each week starts on a Tuesday; its problem set is due ten
days later on the Friday.  The "practice" column gives some
straightforward problems from Tipler.  Use them for studying.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>Please ask questions during lectures and sections.  If there is
something you don't understand, many other students are having the
same trouble&nbsp;- guaranteed.</p>

<p>If there is some aspect of the pace, content, or structure of the
course you don't like, or any other feedback you would like to give,
please let Prof Hogg know as soon as possible.  If you wait until
course evaluation forms are handed out at the end of the semester, you
will have benefited next year's class at the expense of your own!</p>
